# How I worked

## Learning Vue.js

Firstly, I didn't know any of new web frameworks, so I thought it would be a great challenge to start learning a new one.

I chose Vue.js based on how much I hear about this framework.

To learn it, I mainly based on the official documentation.

## What I did

First, I ran this command: `npm create vue@latest`

I used Visual Studio Code with the official vue extension

Then, I started only to create the designs with the tri state buttons (Todo, In progress, Done).

I faced the problem that all my tri state buttons were linked together, so i had to provide a different id and name foreach tri state button.
To do so, I used the power of Vue.js with props as I could read in the docs, and also some computed property for the id to follow the official documentation.
